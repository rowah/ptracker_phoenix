## The app prevent product wastage through expiry.

The Application lets you upload products, key in product name, description, the dates of manufacture and expiry, and show the user how long they have till their product expires.

I had initially built the app using a different set of tech stack but after I started learning Elixir I decided to build it using Phoenix, an Elixir framework.
